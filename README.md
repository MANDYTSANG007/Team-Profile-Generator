# Team-Profile-Generator

Team Profile Generator is a command-line application written in Node.js. This application takes in information and then generates a HTML webpage that displays summaries for each personnel. Unit tests are also incorporated in this application to make the code maintainable. 


## Getting Started

This application prompts the user for information about the team manager and then it gives options to add engineers or interns. When all team members have been added, this application generates a teamProfile.html.
